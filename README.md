* Project to classify fake news from real news. 
* This project relies on the hybrid model of Language and ML approach as described in the research papers listed below. The model uses a semantic 
analysis to determine the truthfulness. 
* Devising framework with legitimizing signals of ambigious posts to detect fake news.
